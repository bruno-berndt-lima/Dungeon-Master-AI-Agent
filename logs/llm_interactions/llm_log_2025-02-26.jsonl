On a failure, the creature is petrified \nuntil freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. \nA creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the \nsaving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see \nthe basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its \neyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must \nimmediately make the save. \nIf the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright \nlight, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze. \nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. \nHit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. \nBASILISK \nTravelers sometimes find objects that look like pieces of \nremarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing \nparts appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers \nregard such relics as warnings, knowing that the\n\nbasilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a \nrapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous \nstone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to \nconsume the stone. The stone returns to organic form in \nthe basilisk's gullet. \nSome alchemists are said to know how to process \nthe basilisk's gullet and the fluids contained within. \nProperly handled, the gullet produces an oil that can \nreturn petrified creatures to flesh and life. Unfortunately \nfor such a victim, any parts lost in stone form remain \nabsent if the creature revives. Revivification using the \noil is impossible if a vital part of the petrified creature, \nsuch as its head, is detached.\n\nremarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing \nparts appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers \nregard such relics as warnings, knowing that the \nbasilisk that created them is likely to be nearby. \nAdaptable Predators. Basilisks thrive in arid, \ntemperate, or tropical climates. They lair in caves \nor other sheltered sites. Most often, basilisks are \nencountered underground. \nA basilisk born and raised in captivity can be \ndomesticated and trained. Such a trained basilisk \nknows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master \nwishes to protect from its gaze, but it makes a daunting \nguardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are \nhighly prized. \nGaze of Stone. Basilisks are ponderous for hunting \ncreatures, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a \nbasilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a \nrapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous \nstone.

According to the D&D 5th Edition Player's Handbook (p. 27), a roll of 1 on a d20 is considered a critical failure.\n\nWhen you roll a 1, your character's action fails miserably. The DM can choose to describe the consequences of this failure in creative and often humorous ways.\n\nFor example, if you're trying to cast a spell, rolling a 1 might cause you to turn yourself into a frog instead (as per the \"Frog\" option in the Player's Handbook, p. 172). If you're attacking an enemy, rolling a 1 might result in your character tripping and falling over.\n\nThe DM has the final say on how to resolve this critical failure, but rest assured that it will be an entertaining and memorable moment for everyone at the table!", "metadata": {}}

(p. 294, *Player's Handbook*)\n*   **Slashing Damage**: If the trap deals slashing damage, it can be calculated using a similar formula: the trap's damage dice are rolled, and the result is added to the target's hit point total.\n\n**Special Cases**\n-----------------\n\nSome traps have special cases that affect the damage calculation:\n\n*   **Poisonous Traps**: Poisonous traps deal poison damage. The poison damage is calculated as follows:\n    *   Roll a d8 (or another number of dice specified by the DM) and add the result to the target's hit point total.\n    *   If the result equals or exceeds 15, the target takes additional damage equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum +1).\n    *   The poison damage is then added to the trap's bludgeoning or piercing damage. (p. 294, *Player's Handbook*)\n*   **Explosive Traps**: Explosive traps deal force damage. The force damage is calculated as follows:\n    *   Roll a d8 (or another number of dice specified by the DM) and add the result to the target's hit point total.\n    *   If the result equals or exceeds 15, the target takes additional damage equal to their Constitution modifier (minimum +1).\n    *   The force damage is then added to the trap's bludgeoning or piercing damage. (p. 294, *Player's Handbook*)\n\n**Tips and Interpretations**\n-----------------------------\n\nWhen dealing with traps, it's essential to consider the DM's discretion when calculating damage. Some common interpretations include:\n\n*   When rolling damage dice for a trap, some players may choose to roll multiple times to account for uncertainty.\n*   In cases where the target is hit by multiple parts of the trap (e.g., both bludgeoning and piercing), the total damage can be calculated by adding the results together.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that these are just common interpretations and not official rules. Always consult the *Player's Handbook* or other official sources for clarification on specific rules and mechanics.", "metadata": {}}

It's a simple yet powerful concept that helps to create excitement, tension, and strategic depth in combat encounters.\n\nIn essence, the Rule of Initiative states that:\n\n1. When two or more characters engage in combat, each character rolls a dice (usually a d20) to determine who acts first.\n2. The character with the highest roll goes first, resolving their action before the next highest roll can act.\n3. If there is a tie, the initiative is re-rolled.\n\nThis rule creates an element of unpredictability and excitement in combat, as players must carefully consider when to attack, defend, or use special abilities. It also encourages strategic thinking, as players must weigh the risks and benefits of taking their turn first versus waiting for a better opportunity.\n\nThe Rule of Initiative has become a standard feature in many RPGs, including Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), Pathfinder, and other fantasy settings. Its simplicity belies its impact on gameplay, making it an essential component of many tabletop RPG experiences.", "metadata": {"rag_used": true}}
